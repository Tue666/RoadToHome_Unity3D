  description: "Sapphire is a precious gemstone The name sapphire is derived from
    the Latin \"saphirus\" and the Greek \"sapheiros\", both of which mean blue.
    Commonly, natural sapphires are cut and polished into gemstones and worn in jewelry.
    They also may be created synthetically in laboratories for industrial or decorative
    purposes in large crystal boules. Because of the remarkable hardness of sapphires
    \u2013 9 on the Mohs scale (the third hardest mineral, after diamond at 10 and
    moissanite at 9.5) \u2013 sapphires are also used in some non-ornamental applications,
    such as infrared optical components, high-durability windows, wristwatch crystals
    and movement bearings, and very thin electronic wafers, which are used as the
    insulating substrates of special-purpose solid-state electronics such as integrated
    circuits and GaN-based blue LEDs. Sapphire is the birthstone for September and
    the gem of the 45th anniversary. A sapphire jubilee occurs after 65 years.\r\nThe
    Sapphire stone have a high price so you need sell it for the shop, so you can
    buy something you want.\r\n\r\nObtained from defeating zombies in the industrial."
