  description: 'Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged
    in a crystal structure called diamond cubic. At room temperature and pressure,
    another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form
    of carbon, but diamond converts to it extremely slowly. Diamond has the highest
    hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material, properties that are
    used in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. They
    are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures
    found deep in the Earth.

    The emerald stone have a highest price so you
    need sell it for the shop, so you can buy something you want.
